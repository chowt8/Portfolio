                Sometimes a home needs a little TLC before it can be listed for sale, and that work can range from fresh
                paint, new flooring, swapping out old appliances, repairing the roof&mdash;the list goes on and on.
                With Redfin Home Services a seller can get a fully managed renovation plan, and listing prep with no
                money upfront until the home is sold. Since joining the team in 2020 I have worked on every piece
                of Home Services from the plan presented to the seller at the outset of a project, to the work list our
                field team and contractors rely on to make that plan reality. By building a deep understanding of this
                domain, I have been able to deliver design solutions that streamline essential workflows
                for a growing org of home renovation professionals.

                As the Senior Product Designer on Home Services I have led a majority of the design execution, user
                research, and project prioritization since late 2020.
                A few key achievements from 2020&mdash;2022:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I overhauled our stage and status tracking system, eliminating our dependency on Zendesk for
                    grainular status tracking.
                </li>


                <li>
                    I advocated for and designed a map view that gives our teams in the field a bird’s eye viewpoint of
                    all the projects they are responsible for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I revamped our photo taking and gallery experience on mobile and iPad making it faster and
                    increasing its usability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I helped reduce the time it takes to create and send project bids and contracts to a client by
                    replacing a process that manually generates docs with one that is automated and editable.

                </li>
            </ul>
