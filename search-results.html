        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p> 
            I joined the search user experience team in 2018 at the tipping point of our core consumer teams embarking on modernization
            efforts to refresh the existing ui across all platforms. Our existing design system which had been incepted nearly a decade 
            prior was reaching the end of its lifecycle and was not supporting newer initiatives. 
        </p>

        <p>
            On mobile specifically device sizes had rapidly grown so our typography scale was not optimized for larger screens.
            User feedback pointed out search results are very cluttered, hard to parse, seem to aggressively prioritize paid advertisements for business.

        </p>

        <p> We were also finding that the existing format of search results were not set up to show more unique business attributes, value propositions,
            personalized annotations, local insights, feature awareness building promotions, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The original one size fits all design did not consider 
            search results ever growing in the way that it did, so it was necessary to reset and think critically about how search results will be used 
            in the short term and long-term.  

        </p>

       

        <h4>The plan</h4>
        <p>
            The search user experience team decided to roll out a refreshed ui to accompany the ui refresh of business pages and the home page / nearby page. 
            With personalization in the works this would be an opportunity to make search results show more relevant information to a person’s search 
            and interests and address some of the user feedback around how cluttered and hard to read search results were at the time.
        </p>

        <h4>My role</h4>
        <p> 
            The designer I previously collaborated with on the homescreen redesign had departed Yelp leaving me as the sole designer on the search 
            team. I led design on this entire project as well as overseeing several other projects at the same time. I chose to 
            use Zeppelin as the primary handoff tool which our engineering team found to be incredible valuable and asked for it to become the standard going forward.
            I was able to forge some great relationships with different engineers on the search results team as well as earn some trust from the team at large with this project.

        </p>

      
        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p> 
            We limited this project to adjust the typographic scale, adding more breathing room / white space, 
            to reflect the changes happening on the business pages and nearby / homescreen. Piling on changes to filters, 
            the search bar experience would add to many moving pieces for us to measure movement in metrics effectively so we 
            kept the scope relatively tight.

        </p>

        <h4>Measuring success</h4>
        <p> 
            Our goal was to make sure no metrics around advertisements were adversely affected. In an A/B We were surprised to actually see an
            increased engagement on Ads after introducing more spacing and larger typography as well as an increase in action on food delivery,
            request a quote and a few other actions at the search results level. One theory is that the buttons on the search results were lost in the 
            clutter, but the addition of spacing actually 
        </p>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p> 
            I had to continuously loop in other teams forced on different parts of the Yelp experience like food delivery, 
            home and local services or reservations to make sure that our updated search results would serve their needs. 
            In some ways this was a pseudo design systems project and initiative.
