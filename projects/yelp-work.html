            <p style="--animation-order: 3;">
                When I joined Yelp in early 2018, the company had just set off on a journey of building personalization
                into its user experience. Before any of that uniquely personal content could appear in the product, it
                was my job to update the designs of the most highly trafficked screen at the start of a search: the home
                screen and search results experience. The goal was to make the suggested businesses and categories on
                Yelp feel personalized, relevant, and contextual. This manifested in a new photo driven header component
                on the homescreen, unique business highlights within search results, and various experiments we ran that
                promoted finding businesses that feel relevant to your search and preferences. The largest challenge
                faced during this project was balancing a larger business goal to expose Yelp users to categories beyond
                just food.

                Being a designer for the Search experience meant interacting with every other product team at Yelp. The
                role gave me a privileged vantage point to identify opportunities for separate teams to combine efforts
                and unify their design which helped avoid similar experiences being built twice. In a way my role as a
                product designer on the search team was also serving as a primitive design systems designer, which was a
                role that did not exist at Yelp yet.
