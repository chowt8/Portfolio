        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
            I joined the Search User Experience (Search UX) team at the precipice of several consumer facing teams investing in modernization across all platforms. Essentially these teams wanted the home screen, search results and business pages to move forward together in a unified refresh to support more personlization and end to end experiences. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            The existing design system which had been incepted nearly a decade prior was reaching the end of its lifecycle and was not supporting newer initiatives. With no northstar yet guiding a shared product and desig vision most teams at this point and time would introduce one-off "modernized" refreshs to help move the conversation forward.
        </p>
             
        <p>
            Mobile search results in particular were suffering as our typography scale was optimized for iphone 5 era devices and had not been updated since. From a qualitative standpoint, feedback from Yelp users pointed out that search results were very cluttered, hard to parse and seem to aggressively prioritize paid advertisements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Search UX's roadmap to introduce unique business attributes, value propositions, personalized annotations, local insights, feature awareness building promotions would put too much stress on the existing format as well as our users so it was necessary to reset and think critically about how search results could be updated in the short term and establish a long-term goal to work towards.
        </p>
            

        <h4>The plan</h4>
        <p>
            The Search UX team coordinated with Yelp's Business page team to rollout refreshed UI to the mobile apps home screen, search results and business pages. That way people utilizing the Yelp app would have a more unified experience from a design perspective from the beginning of their search to the point that land on a business's page.
        </p>

        <p>
            With personalization in the works this was also an opportunity to explore how search results can show more relevant information to a person’s search, interests and address some of the user feedback around how cluttered and hard to read search results were.
        </p>
            

        <h4>My role</h4>
        <p>
            The designer I previously collaborated with on the home screen redesign had departed Yelp leaving me as the sole designer on Search UX. Thus I led design on this entire project while continuing to push other projects forward for a handful of months.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to owning all of the design work and communicating our progress to other teams, I introduce Zeppelin as the primary handoff tool during this project. My main engineering partners found it to be incredibly valuable and asked for it to become the standard handoff tool going forward.
        </p>
            

        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>
            We limited this project to adjust the typographic scale, adding more breathing room / white space, to reflect the changes happening on the business pages and the updates we had made to our home screen on mobile.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I did explore ways to update our filters and other enhancements like lazy loading and bookmarking, it was decided to keep our scope tight and avoid addtoo much additional effort to deliver those features work and just be difficult to track from a metric perspective. Some of that work was slotted into our roadmap later on.
        </p>

      
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
            The largest hurdle to clear during this project was making sure other teams gave their blessing on all of the changes I was proposing.  Search results are the front of other team’s experiences like food delivery, home and local services or reservations so I had to ensure all the changes I made would serve everyones’ goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            In some ways this was a design systems initiative that intended to make sure every team can properly showcase the value propositions in a clear and intentful way. 
        </p>
             
        <p>
            We saw some promising early numbers after running an A/B experiment for a month, these designs eventually ramped up to 100% for all users and became the status quo.
