                As a designer on the Search experience team I had to interact with every other product team at Yelp as
                search is the entryway to the bulk of Yelp's experience. This was a great vantage point to identify
                opportunities for separate teams to combine efforts
                and unify their desigs when it was obvious they had similar goals and needs. In a way my role was also a
                proto design systems designer as I had to ensure that every new component introduced could service
                multiple teams needs and scale.
