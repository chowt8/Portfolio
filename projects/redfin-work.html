                The Home Services business at Redfin renovates and preps homes before they are listed for sale which
                typically makes them more appealing to buyers and allows them to list for higher.
                I have spent my time on the team building domain expertise and delivering design solutions that
                streamline essential
                workflows for a growing org of home renovation professionals.

                As the Senior Product Designer on Home Services I have led a majority of the design execution, user
                research, and project prioritization since late 2020.
                A few key achievements from 2020&mdash;2022:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I overhauled our stage and status tracking system, eliminating our dependency on Zendesk for
                    grainular status tracking.
                </li>


                <li>
                    I advocated for and designed a map view that gives our teams in the field a bird’s eye viewpoint of
                    all the projects they are responsible for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I revamped our photo taking and gallery experience on mobile and iPad making it faster and
                    increasing its usability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I helped reduce the time it takes to create and send project bids and contracts to a client by
                    replacing a process that manually generates docs with one that is automated and editable.

                </li>
            </ul>
