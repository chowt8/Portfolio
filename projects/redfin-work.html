                Sometimes a home needs some work before it can be listed for sale, and with Redfin Home Services a
                seller can get a fully managed renovation plan, plus listing prep, with no
                money out of pocket until the home sells. Since joining the team in 2020, I have touched every piece
                of Home Services from the plan presented to the seller at the outset of a project, to the work list our
                field team relies on to make that plan a reality. My approach was build a deep understanding of this
                domain, and that has allowed me to deliver design solutions that streamline workflows and introduce new functionality
                for a growing org of home renovation professionals.

                As the Senior Product Designer on Home Services I have led a majority of the design execution, user
                research, and project prioritization since late 2020.
                A few key achievements from 2020&mdash;2022:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I overhauled our stage and status tracking system, eliminating our dependency on Zendesk for
                    grainular status tracking.
                </li>


                <li>
                    I advocated for and designed a map view that gives our teams in the field a bird’s eye viewpoint of
                    all the projects they are responsible for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I revamped our photo taking and gallery experience on mobile and iPad making it faster and
                    increasing its usability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I helped reduce the time it takes to create and send project bids and contracts to a client by
                    replacing a process that manually generates docs with one that is automated and editable.

                </li>
            </ul>
