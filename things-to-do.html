        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p> For a handful of months I worked in close partnership with a product manager on scoping out and designing how Yelp could expand into a category called
             <em>Things To Do (TTD)</em> on Yelp. This category encapsulates:

        <ul>
           <li>Sightseeing tours</li>
           <li>Tourist attractions</li>
           <li>National parks and monuments</li>
           <li>Outdoor recreation, hikes and trails</li>
           <li>Museums and art venues</li>
           <li>Anything with a ticket purchase</li>
           <li>Anything with an in-advance reservation</li>
           <li>Local events listed on Yelp</li>
        </ul>

        <p> 
            Our hypothesis was if people can directly secure tickets or reservations in the Yelp app for the above experiences then we would see
            growth, increased engagement and higher awareness of things to do categories. Much like Yelp's previous foray into food delivery and existing 
            initiatives around home and local services this would be a large push to broaden and diversify Yelp's offerings beyond restaurants. 
        </p>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p> 
            In the first phase of this project I was tasked with designing an integration for a ticket 
            booking partner. The integration would keep people within the Yelp app for the full end-to-end experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Phase 2. My product partner and I conducted a series of remote user interviews, examined available search data,
            and visualized a things to do centric discovery experience, that has to co-exist with everything else on Yelp.
        </p>

        <h4>My role and the team</h4>

        <p> 
            I was accountable for all of the design work during this initiative from the wireframes and iterations to the visuals you see here. I also did 
            competitive research, wrote our user interview guide, conducted remote user interviews, handpicked all the photography, and wrote all the copy. 
            I worked closely with one product manager on this effort, and presented back to our main stakeholders to pitch its viability.
        </p>

        <h4>Highlights and notes from design</h4>
        <p> Having previously led design on our revamped search results and homescreen, I showcased how our top of funnel could easily build awareness of things to do
            categories and surface unique offerings and deals. I even went as far to sketch out some things to do specific icons to grow our illustration library.
        </p>

        <p> We realized it was unique that points of interest, like Alcatraz Island, and businesses that provide tours to Alcatraz, like Red & White Fleet,
            both have a presence on Yelp as a "business" page. This makes it easier for people to arrive at a ticket purchase or reservation no matter how they go about their search.
        </p>

        <p> I used Yelp's Grubhub integration as a model to build off of and set constraints to stick within our existing library of components, patterns and 
            screens. This was to ensure our first MVP would be realistically scoped.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I designed, I found that our food delivery menus naturally lent themselves to hosting a service provider's offerings, while our newly
            designed native checkout experience could facilitate the ticket purchase and reservation.  
        </p>

        <h4>The big question</h4>
        <p> While all the previous work was being fitted into our future roadmap my partner and I began tackling the research.
            We wanted to find out if a things to do experience built around local or travel would have broader appeal with existing Yelp users. 
        </p>
        <p> We spoke to 6 people remotely for one hour each to get a sense of their unique perspectives when it comes to finding and committing to things to do locally and while traveling.
        </p>
        <p> With some juicy research highlights in hand we gathered with some other key team members to help generate a few different discovery experiences 
            to take back out for some concept validation with users.
        </p>

        <h4>Ideas we liked and next steps</h4>
        <p> We landed on two ideas that we thought were realistic enough to puruse. The first idea proposed we bring city pages,
            which are only available on the Yelp's webiste and create location focused discovery pages. They would weave together city highlights,
            events and all things that are conveiably "things to do".
        </p>

        <h4>Final thoughts</h4>

        <p>I see multiple successes in this project. Our phased approach enabled my 
            partner and I to cover a lot of ground. Starting with the integration and limited scope we were able to 
            pressure test our transaction paradigms from food delivery on this new use case. Finally, the 
            research and design workshop highlighted unique ways to weave in existing city pages
            (from web) and events on Yelp which are otherwise not prominently featured anywhere else.
        </p>
