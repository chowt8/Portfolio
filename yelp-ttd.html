        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p> During the first few months of 2019 I worked closely with a product manager on a expansion proposal into the vast 
            space of <em>Things To Do (TTD)</em> on Yelp. Our goal was to create new avenues for people to find:

        <ul>
           <li>Sightseeing tours</li>
           <li>Tourist attractions</li>
           <li>National parks and monuments</li>
           <li>Outdoor recreation, hikes and trails</li>
           <li>Museums and art venues</li>
           <li>Anything with a ticket purchase</li>
           <li>Anything with an in-advance reservation</li>
           <li>Local events listed on Yelp</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Coupling a discovery experience with an intergated booking feature would provide people a way to secure tickets or reservations directly from Yelp's app 
            or website without being pushed to a 3rd party experience.
            
        </p>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p> There were two large phases to this initiative. In Phase 1., I was asked to quickly design an experience that integrates a ticket 
            booking partner into Yelp's iOS app. <br> In Phase 2., a product manager and I conducted a series of remote user interviews, examined available search data,
            and organized a generative design workshop to visualize how a TTD discovery experience could co-exist with everything else Yelp has to offer.
        </p>

        <h4>My role and the team</h4>
        <p> I owned all of the design work during this initiative from low to high fidelity. In addition to the final visuals I also did 
            competitive research, wrote our research interview guide, conducted remote user interviews, handpicked all the photography, and wrote all the copy. 
            I worked in very close partnership with one product manager on this effort for over two months.

        <h4>Searching for things to do</h4>
        <p> Having previously led design on our revamped search results and homescreen, I showcased how our top of funnel could easily build awareness of things to do
            categories and surface unique offerings and deals. I even went as far to sketch out some things to do specific icons to grow our illustration library.</p>

<div class="flex-container">
    <div class="inner-flex paragraph">
        <h4>Two is greater than one</h4>
        <p> Something we realized that was unique about things to do categories is that points of interest, like Alcatraz Island, and businesses that provide tours to Alcatraz, like Red & White Fleet,
            both have a presence on Yelp as a "business" page. This makes it easier for people to find available inventory and book it whether they go to the point of interest page first 
            or directly to the service provider's business page on Yelp.

        <h4>Using our existing paradigms</h4>
        <p> I used Yelp's Grubhub integration as a model to build off of and set constraints to stick within our existing library of components, patterns and 
            screens. This was to ensure our first MVP would be realistically scoped. </p>

        <p> While the partner integration was being assessed and scoped out, my partner and I began tackling the research. The main question we 
            wanted to answer was which use case has broader appeal from existing Yelp users: Surfacing things to do locally (where someone lives)
            or things to do while traveling (planned vacations / destinations).

        <h4>Ideas we liked and next steps</h4>
        <p> We landed on two ideas that we thought were realistic enough to puruse. The first one was appropriating our city pages that are only available on the Yelp website and location focused discover pages.
            They would weave together city highlights, events and all things that are conveiably "things to do".

            The other idea that drew directly from what we heard during our remote user sessions was creating itneraries with swappable steps and "one stop shopping" booking buttons. We felt this could live
            in isolation but potentially also expand upon our existing collections tab.

    <p>I see multiple successes in this project. Our phased approach enabled my 
        partner and I to cover a lot of ground. By starting with the integration we were able to 
        pressure test our transaction paradigms from food delivery into this new use case. Finally, the 
        research and design workshop highlighted unique ways to weave in existing city pages
        (from web) and events on Yelp which are otherwise not prominently featured anywhere else.
