Hey this is my portfolio website v.2!
I coded my first from scratch website in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic and had a lot of help from:

@kgoedecke
@rektdeckard
@theresama
@mxmul

In this new version I tried to simplify and write some cleaner code and thanks to Codecademy I know what CSS variables are now!

I also found a cool media query (thanks to @kevin-powell) that enables a dark-mode color scheme depending on the user's general appearance seetting - so if you set your system color scheme to auto you'll see you this website shift to night mode!

I can also thank @kevin-powell for his tutorial on how to fade-in content based on scroll
